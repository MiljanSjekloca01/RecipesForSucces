        text: "Vitamin C is a vitamin found in humans and many animal species. In living organisms, ascorbate acts as an antioxidant, protecting the body from oxidative stress. It is also a cofactor in at least six enzymatic reactions, including several involved in collagen synthesis, whose dysfunction is manifested through symptoms of scurvy. Despite claims made by some over-the-counter remedies, it doesn’t prevent colds. But once you have symptoms, drink orange or grapefruit juice to help yourself stay hydrated. Your symptoms may not go away any sooner,  but staying hydrated can help you feel better while your symptoms run their course.  Your body also needs vitamin C to help your bones, skin, and muscles grow. You'll get enough by including bell peppers, papaya, strawberries, broccoli, cantaloupe, leafy greens, and other fruits and veggies in your diet.",

        text: "Vitamin A (Retinol, Axerophthol) does not hold the first place in the list of vitamins only because of alphabetical order, but due to its numerous important functions in the body. Vitamin A protects cell membranes and strengthens the skin and mucous membranes, helping to prevent various infections and uncontrolled tissue growth, earning it the title of protector of the entire body. It plays a particularly important role in vision physiology, as it participates in the creation of the visual pigment (rhodopsin) found in the rod cells of the retina. It is also believed that vitamin A enhances the function of the immune system and helps prevent some infectious diseases. The other type is in plant foods. It helps prevent damage to cells and an eye problem called age-related macular degeneration. (But too much vitamin A can hurt your liver.) Eat orange veggies and fruits like sweet potato and cantaloupe, spinach and other greens, dairy foods, and seafood such as shrimp and salmon.",

        text: "Vitamin B1, or thiamine, is a water-soluble vitamin that must be regularly obtained through food or supplements since it is not stored in the body. It plays a crucial role in converting glucose into energy and is important for cellular metabolism, providing the energy needed for daily activities. Vitamin B1 is abundant in vegetables and meats, particularly in grains, legumes, eggs, pork, and yeast. The daily requirement varies by gender: men need 1.2 mg, while women require 0.9 mg, which can be met through a balanced diet. A deficiency can damage the nervous and cardiovascular systems, leading to symptoms like difficulty swallowing, vomiting, excessive salivation, and weight loss. Severe deficiency may result in cardiac and neurological disorders, dilated pupils, and sensitivity of the spine, potentially leading to vascular lesions, coma, or even death. Fortunately, there are no known side effects from excessive intake, as surplus vitamin B1 is easily excreted in urine.",

        text: "Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin) is vital for energy production, red blood cell formation, and maintaining healthy skin and mucous membranes. It helps the body absorb vitamin B6 and produce niacin (B3). Sources of B2 include milk, eggs, yogurt, cheese, leafy greens, avocados, whole grains, nuts, legumes, liver, and fish. Since it’s water-soluble, excess amounts are expelled through urine. Deficiency in riboflavin can cause skin irritation, mouth sores, throat pain, and anemia.",

It's found in yeast, liver, grains, meat, fish, dairy, nuts, seeds, and green vegetables. Deficiency in B3 can lead to pellagra, which manifests through dermatitis, diarrhea, and mental disturbances like dementia. Alcohol and refined sugar consumption can deplete niacin levels in the body, so maintaining a balanced diet is crucial.",

        text: "Vitamin D is essential for calcium absorption and bone health. It regulates calcium and phosphate levels, promoting strong bones and teeth. Sunlight triggers the body to produce vitamin D, but it can also be sourced from fish liver oil, dairy, meat, fish, eggs, yeast, and mushrooms. A lack of vitamin D leads to bone disorders like rickets in children and osteoporosis in adults. Adequate sunlight or dietary intake is essential for preventing deficiencies, particularly in individuals who avoid sun exposure.",
